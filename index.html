                            The UNSA Racing Team is a formula student team situated at the University of Sarajevo.
                            Founded in 2024, our team consists of passionate students driven by a shared enthusiasm for
                            motorsports and automotive innovation. Our participation in the Formula Student competition
                            marks a significant milestone in our journey to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world
                            engineering challenges.
                            <br><br>
                            The student team is closely aligned with the academic goals of the University. Our
                            involvement in the competition complements classroom learning by offering students the
                            opportunity to apply theoretical concepts in a real-world context. Through participation in
                            Formula Student, students enhance their problem-solving abilities, critical thinking skills,
                            and technical expertise.

                        Formula Student is a global engineering competition that challenges university students to
                        design,
                        build, and race in a formula-style event. Teams from all around the world participate in this
                        annual
                        event, showcasing their skills and knowledge in areas such as design, manufacturing, testing,
                        and business presentation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The competition not only emphasizes the technical aspects of building a high-performance race
                        car but also encourages students to develop project management and teamwork skills.
                        Participants must adhere to strict rules and regulations while pushing the boundaries of
                        innovation to create a competitive vehicle.
